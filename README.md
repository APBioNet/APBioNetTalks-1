# APBioNetTalks

Welcome to APBioNetTalks!
This program is a part of Asia Pacific Bioinformatics Network (APBioNet). It will serve as an online platform to host and stream bioinformatics related talks, tutorials, and training. The program aims to make the learning of bioinformatics to be more engaging, inclusive and accessible. We will invite experts, early career researchers/scientists, and Ph.D. students to share their knowledge and skills. Upon the completion of live streaming, the videos will be archived and available on-demand. This will provide community with open bioinformatics resources. In the process, we hope to promote the discovery and sharing of bioinformatics.

Video-based learning resources for bioinformatics are still scarce. Some of them are not available in English. If available, they are not free. Even if they are free, they usually only cover the introduction or very basic discussions. While most of the specific and intermediate-to-advanced discussions or skills are not accessible. This hampers the potential use of bioinformatics in solving complex biological problems. Using APBioNetTalks, we plan to solve this problem by providing open access video-based bioinformatics learning resources for the public.
